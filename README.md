# OrbitalCI

OrbitalCI is a self-hostable continuous integration system written in Rust.

All Continuous Integration systems are essentially fancy script executors. OrbitalCI is no different. What makes OrbitalCI different from other continuous integration systems?

* OrbitalCI is a container-first builder as a strategy for reproducing builds w/o cache implicitly affecting the failure or success.
* Users interact with OrbitalCI via command line interface. They can build, watch live logs and view history of their repo builds.
* Build environments and build instructions are laid out in a yaml configuration file that lives in the root of your code repo.
* Other self-hosted or private infrastructure (such as artifact repositories or Slack organizations) are supported in your builds.

## Roadmap

OrbitalCI's roadmap for 2019 is located [here](roadmap.md)

## Developers

To get started, just run `make`.

### Requirements on host
* Rust 1.39+
* Docker 
* make
* git

Note: Docker container exec only works on Linux hosts due to https://github.com/softprops/shiplift/issues/155

### Getting started with Vagrant
#### Requirements on host
The following tools need to be installed on your host.

* Vagrant
* Virtualbox
  * If you use a different Vagrant provider, you may need to set your `VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` environment variable.
  * See [the Vagrant docs](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/default.html) for more detail

From root of the repo:
`vagrant up`

The codebase will share/sync the current directory in the VM under `/home/vagrant/orbitalci`.

### Getting started with Docker

This image is not yet ready for active usage, but it can be used for manual testing of the cli through `orb dev [...]` commands.

To manually build the container from root of the repo:
`docker build -t orb .`

## Contributing 

Fork the repo and issue a pull request.

Inspired by the [Rust governance process](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance), large or potentially backwards incompatible changes should be socialized by opening an issue with the `RFC` label.

Conversation aims to mainly occur in the Github issues. This process is being developed to provide transparency of intent when decisions are made. The desire is to allow stakeholders time to engage with objections, but have process to continue moving forward if there is a lack of response within a reasonable time period.

When an RFC's details are worked out and ready for final comment, similar but less formal to Rust's governance, `RFC` issues, the issue opener, or the maintainers should call out in the comments stating final changes are in.

At this point, more changes may be required due to new comments. But after 10 calendar days (at least 5 business days), code or additional design based on this RFC is acceptable.

Updates to this process are welcome and should also be introduced via Github issue using `RFC` label.
